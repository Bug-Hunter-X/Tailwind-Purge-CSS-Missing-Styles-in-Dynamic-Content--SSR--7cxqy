The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS correctly identifies the dynamically generated content during the purging process.  This can be achieved by using the `@apply` directive, extracting the CSS from the dynamic components directly, or by using a custom purge configuration to specifically include the relevant classes.

One approach is to use the `@apply` directive instead of utility classes directly in dynamic content that could be problematic, such as: 

```javascript
// bug.js
<div className="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  {/* Dynamic content */}  
  {items.map((item) => (
    <div key={item.id} className="@apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-2">{item.name}</div>
  ))}
</div>
```

Another approach is to manually include the relevant classes in a CSS file and then import that CSS file into your main CSS file or your Tailwind config file. 

By either using `@apply` or manually specifying the dynamic classes, you ensure that Tailwind's purge mechanism includes them, preventing the missing styles issue.
