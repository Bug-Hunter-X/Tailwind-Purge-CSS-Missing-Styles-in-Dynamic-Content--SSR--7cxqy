This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue arises when Tailwind's purge feature is enabled, and it fails to correctly identify and include all the necessary styles used in dynamically generated content.  As a result, some components will be missing their Tailwind styles on the client-side rendering, causing styling issues.
